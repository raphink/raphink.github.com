My work in Augeas has been mostly to write lenses for common Unix configuration files. As such, my main language of contribution has been the [Augeas language](https://www.ohloh.net/languages/augeas) itself.\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, I also added C code to this project, the main part being the XML export API call.\r\n\r\nI maintain Augeas packages in Ubuntu (and a [PPA for new versions](https://launchpad.net/~raphink/+archive/augeas)).\r\n\r\nIn 2011, I have begun writing an open-source [book about Augeas](https://github.com/raphink/Augeas-book), which is still a work in progress.\r\n\r\n## Perl\r\n\r\nIn the first company where I worked as a sysadmin, Perl was used a lot (now it's mostly Ruby). I got used to writing tools (and sometimes whole programs) in Perl, some of which I contributed back to the [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~raphink/):\r\n\r\n* [Config::Augeas::Exporter](http://search.cpan.org/~raphink/Config-Augeas-Exporter-v1.0.0/), a module to export the Augeas to various format. This was mostly used as a prototype for the XML export API call in Augeas, now rewritten in C;\r\n* [Config::Augeas::Validator](http://search.cpan.org/~raphink/Config-Augeas-Validator-1.300/), a tool to validate configuration files using Augeas. I plan to port this to Ruby and integrate it in Puppet;\r\n* [Config::KingKong](http://search.cpan.org/~raphink/Config-KingKong-0.002/), a simple templating tool to generate configuration files;\r\n* [Reprepro::Uploaders](http://search.cpan.org/~raphink/Reprepro-Uploaders-0.004/), a module that emulates [reprepro](http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/) upload rights.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, I also co-maintain the [Config::Augeas](http://search.cpan.org/~raphink/Config-Augeas-0.903/) module (Perl bindings for Augeas) with [Dominique Dumont](http://search.cpan.org/~ddumont/).\r\n\r\nAnother Perl project, [Diathica](https://launchpad.net/diathica) is a Twitter/Identica Bible bot.\r\n\r\n## Puppet\r\n\r\nI have been interested in [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com) since 2006. The company I worked for at the time was not interested in replacing Cfengine with it, so I mostly played with it on my own.\r\n\r\nSince April 2012, I have the pleasure of working for [a company](http://www.camptocamp.com) that has been using Puppet for years, and knows the value of [contributing back](http://github.com/camptocamp).\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I am recently contributing more and more Puppet code through my daily sysadmin hacking.\r\n\r\n## LaTeX\r\n\r\nI started translating books and publishing them in 2011. The more I dove into LaTeX, the more I enjoyed the power of it. On my path to publishing, I released a few modules to [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/author/id/pinson):\r\n\r\n* [fancytabs](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fancytabs) was created to add shaded smart tabs to [a book](https://github.com/cc-translators/sagesse) I am in the process of publishing;\r\n* [fontbook](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontbook) helps to generate a font book in XeTeX/LuaTeX;\r\n* [impnattypo](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/impnattypo) implements French typography recommendations, making heavy use of LuaTeX;\r\n* [moderntimeline](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderntimeline) is an extension to [moderncv](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/) that provides timeline support in a CV;\r\n* [nowidow](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/nowidow) provides helpers to manage widows and orphans;\r\n* [babyloniannum](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/babyloniannum) implements Babylonian numerals;\r\n* [coloredlettrine](https://github.com/raphink/coloredlettrine) is an attempt to create bicolor initials using LaTeX and the [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond) font.\r\n\r\nMost of these packages were implemented as answers to questions on [tex.stackexchange.com](tex.stackexchange.com/users/951/raphink), either my own questions or other people's.\r\n\r\nI also co-maintain the [bibleref-french](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibleref-french) package with [Ma√Øeul Rouquette](http://www.ctan.org/author/id/rouquette).\r\n\r\n## Wave\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Google opened Wave and I found this platform really interesting. I wrote a few robots and extensions for it:\r\n\r\n* [Flammard](https://launchpad.net/wavebiblebot), a Bible bot;\r\n* [Annoty](https://launchpad.net/annoty), a generic, programmable, annotations bot.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\nI enjoy hacking programs that I find interesting and/or useful. When I find one that does almost what I'd like to achieve, I'm more than happy to contribute back my hacks. Git and github have tremendously made this easier, so it's become a habbit to fork and request merges. Such small contributions include:\r\n\r\n* [mcollective](https://github.com/ripienaar/marionette-collective);\r\n* [OSRM](https://github.com/DennisSchiefer/Project-OSRM-Web);\r\n* [ohcount](https://github.com/robinluckey/ohcount);\r\n* [rst2odp](https://github.com/mattharrison/rst2odp)."}
